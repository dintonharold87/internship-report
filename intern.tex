\section{Introduction}\cite{r1}
\subsection{Background of NWSC}
National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) is a public utility company 100 percent owned by the Government of Uganda. The Corporation was established in 1972 under Decree No: 34. At its inception in 1972, the Corporation operated in three (3) major towns of Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe. These laws were revised in 1995 by the NWSC Statute and later on the statute was incorporated in the Laws of Uganda as CAP 317 (Laws of Uganda 2000). The primary aim of this was to revise the objectives, powers and structure of NWSC to enable the corporation operate and provide water \& sewerage services in areas entrusted to it on a sound commercial and viable basis.

NWSC ensures that the water supplied up to the customer's meter is of a very high standard. Customers are requested to maintain the water quality within their premises.

\underline{\textbf{Service Connections}}\\ 
NWSC connects all applicants who meet their standard requirements in the areas where their services exist.\\
\underline{\textbf{Meter Reading}}\\
They read all meters every 30 days.Where this is not possible, a  reasonable estimate is determined using previous consumption trends of the last three consecutive readings.\\
\underline{\textbf{Billing and Bill Distribution}}\\
They maintain a 30 days billing cycle for all customers. The water and sewerage billing is based on the consumption as recorded from the meter. Where a meter is not read, an estimate based on the three correct previous readings is used. The invoice is produced and delivered on the day of meter reading where we have adopted the on spot billing system and where bills are printed in the office, the bill is delivered by the fifth month.\\
\underline{\textbf{Collection of Payments}}\\
Payments can be done by using the e-water payment system using mobile money and through the banks.\\
