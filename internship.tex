\section{Introduction}\cite{r1}
\subsection{Background of NWSC}
National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) is a public utility company 100 percent owned by the Government of Uganda. The Corporation was established in 1972 under Decree No: 34. At its inception in 1972, the Corporation operated in three (3) major towns of Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe. These laws were revised in 1995 by the NWSC Statute and later on the statute was incorporated in the Laws of Uganda as CAP 317 (Laws of Uganda 2000). The primary aim of this was to revise the objectives, powers and structure of NWSC to enable the corporation operate and provide water \& sewerage services in areas entrusted to it on a sound commercial and viable basis.

\underline{\textbf{Service Connections}}\\ 
NWSC connects all applicants who meet their standard requirements in the areas where their services exist.\\
\underline{\textbf{Meter Reading}}\\
They read all meters every 30 days.Where this is not possible, a  reasonable estimate is determined using previous consumption trends of the last three consecutive readings.\\
\underline{\textbf{Billing and Bill Distribution}}\\
They maintain a 30 days billing cycle for all customers. The water and sewerage billing is based on the consumption as recorded from the meter. Where a meter is not read, an estimate based on the three correct previous readings is used. The invoice is produced and delivered on the day of meter reading where we have adopted the on spot billing system and where bills are printed in the office, the bill is delivered by the fifth month.\\
\underline{\textbf{Collection of Payments}}\\
Payments can be done by using the e-water payment system using mobile money and through the banks.\\

\section{The Overall Internship Experience}
\subsection{Inroduction}
This chapter talks about the  new skills gained,experiences as well as the challenges faced and how I managed to solve them during Internship. It also explains the relatedness of University’s taught programmes to the Field work, benefits derived and Career Motivation.
\subsection{Lessons and Experiences}
\begin{itemize}
\item I was able to learn how to work efficiently under minimal Supervision since I was given tasks to do when my supervisor was in serious meetings.
  \item \textbf{Work Ethics related Issue}:Internship is an opportunity to learn the skills and behaviors along with the work values that are required for success in the workplace. Workplace ethics are established codes of conduct that reflect the values of the organization or company where you are employed. I was able to possess the willingness to work hard for my supervisor during my internship period. In addition to working hard it is also important to work smart. This means I acquired the most efficient way to complete tasks and finding ways to save time while completing daily assignments. It’s also important to care about my job and complete all projects while maintaining a positive attitude.
\item \textbf{Practical Skill}:The Internship gave me  the opportunity to connect classroom theory with current industry challenges, and have exposure to the latest technologies. Opportunities to converse and interact with a large pool of talented experienced department members  provided a deeper insight tothe overall operation, as well as providing a valuable pool of resources to assist in completion of internship program. This internship program was exactly what I needed to nurture the lack of practical skills I had. I would acquire practical experience to complement the theoretical content of my studies.
\item \textbf{Theoretical Knowledge}:During my internship period at NWSC ,I was able to  upgrade my theoretical knowledge,from the courseunit  of  Computer Networks in theclassroom for example Microsoft windows server 2016, DNS ,DHCP ,IIS ,FTP and Active directory domain service.
  \item \textbf{Time Management}:  I learnt how to be punctual. NWSC is a busy organization and work had to be done as early as possible arrival time was 7:30am.
\item \textbf{Communication Skills} : I improved on my  communication skills in a formal and informal way. In the formal way as I had to communicate with my supervisor, staff and interacting with people while providing user support.
\item \textbf{Internet Research Skills} : I greatly improved my research skills as most of the things learnt i had to get more knowledge about them so I used a great deal of websites to acquire more knowledge by researching on them.
\item \textbf{Team Work} : I worked with fellow interns in teams on tasks assigned such as the IT stock taking exercise where we had to record the different devices owned by NWSC for example mice, keyboards, laptops,system units,switches,routers and so many others by recording the serial number, make, status and the user. At the end of the exercise we had to come up with a report. 
\item \textbf{Data Entry}: I improved my skills in data entry using software packages like Excel while analyzing data collected from stock taking exercise as well as creating different mail groups and entering data for example a mailgroup for Kampala Water Finance and Administration,KW branch engineers,KW commercial officers, KW commercial assistants, KW Branch Managers.
\item \textbf{Knowledge of the Organisation}: I gained knowledge on the operations of NWSC; and the overall staff conduct and guidelines through orientation which took place in the first week at NWSC IREC.
\item User Support.
\item Network printer Installation.
\item Software Installation.
\item Server Configuration and Management.
\item Microsoft Office Installation.
\item Anti-Virus Installation and Activation.
\item Operating System Installation.
\end{itemize}
